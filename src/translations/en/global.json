To win this right, they will have to get all the runes and the secret they keep to dominate absolute power. Only the first to get this will be the new host at Valhalla, so the rest of the rivals will not make it easy. Live the Runer√∂k experience and play the best strategy to sabotage your rivals and win the glory of such an hero."
